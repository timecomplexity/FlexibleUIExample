# FlexibleUIExample
Quick test project to showcase UI capabilities.

This project features a little cube you can move around with WASD, arrow keys, or a joystick. The controls are not great, but that's not the point of this project. The cube can walk over green portals which will prompt you to go to the next level or purple portals which will prompt you to go to the previous level.

In the third level, there is a blue cube which can be clicked on which will show a "tooltip".

The point of this project is to give some frame of reference and get a little practice with Unity's `ScriptableObject` class. This is a highly versatile and clean way of managing the data in your game and a great way to reduce the number of `Monobehaviour`s asking for updates every frame. Reduce overhead, headaches, and merge conflicts on non-human-readable files!
